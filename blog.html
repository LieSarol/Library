        I built an AI platform because I got emotionally jump-scared by Google Search

          I was just having a normal breakdown, you know? Casual existential stuff. I opened Google like “okay brain, let’s fix us today,” and I typed in “how to stop overthinking.” Seemed innocent. But then BAM — I was hit with a digital tsunami of SEO clickbait.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first link was clearly written by an AI trained to make me feel like I was part of a productivity cult. The second was a Pinterest infographic with 32 pastel ways to “breathe through it.” Then I got ambushed by a YouTube video of a wellness guru whispering affirmations over lo-fi music while rubbing crystals. Not even joking.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s when I realized: we don’t need *more content*. We need *better answers*. So I rage-coded Nexix — a no-fluff AI that just listens to your question and answers. No influencers. No “Top 10 Tips” that tell you to touch grass. Just cold, honest logic from a machine that doesn’t have a skincare routine to sell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nexix doesn’t track your behavior. Doesn’t try to “boost engagement.” It doesn’t care about your zodiac sign, your shadow work, or your favorite breathing pattern. It’s emotionally unavailable, just like me. But it shows up with exactly what you asked for. And honestly? That’s more than I can say for half my friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Features? Yeah, it’s got 'em:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-4 text-white space-y-2">
          <li>No comment section wars.</li>
          <li>No sketchy ads trying to sell you magnesium anxiety gummies.</li>
          <li>No human opinions. Just AI spitting facts like a logic cannon.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Nexix is like your emotionless tech bestie who still checks on you when you're spiraling at 2AM. It's the digital equivalent of a cold shower and a blunt truth. You ask, it answers. Fast. Clean. No detours through Reddit, YouTube, and ten Medium thinkpieces written by dudes named Jake.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wanna try it? Click the link. If it crashes, that's just it trying to relate to your emotional instability. Hit refresh and vibe again.
